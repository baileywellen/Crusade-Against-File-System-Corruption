# Crusade-Against-File-System-Corruption  
 Undergraduate C++ Project in Computer Organization Class  
 
## Project Description  
In this project you will be given one or more xv6 file systems which may or may not have been corrupted in different ways.
Your job is to write an application which reads a file system file and parses the file system contained therein to locate every
instance of corruption, describing each fully in print outs.
You are not responsible for repairing the corruption you find.
